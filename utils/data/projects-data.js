        description: "Me and my team built a website for civic issue reporting and resolution for the SIH problem statement of Jharkhand government. We created an interactive dashboard that allows citizens to report issues with just a few clicks. The system automatically fetches the user's location and supports voice notes. Issues pass through a spam filter model that assigns departments, sets priorities, and filters invalid reports (e.g., mismatched photo/description or non-civic issues). Admins can mark issues as resolved by adding proof, and citizens can track the status from pending → under consideration → resolved. If unsatisfied, the issue can be escalated to a higher authority (super admin), ensuring both reporting and resolution.",
